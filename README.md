This analysis uses word embedding algorithms (and specifically Google's word2vec algorithm) to create a thematic mapping of all the characters in the Harry Potter book series. This mapping then allows to group them into, for lack of a better term, [social cliques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique). Not surprisingly, given the power and accuracy of these types of algorithms, when looking at the map (below and [in high definition](character_visualization)) and the the characters that compose each clique, for someone familiar with the books, the results of the analysis make intuitive sense.
