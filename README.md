This analysis uses word embedding algorithms (and specifically Google's word2vec algorithm) to create a thematic mapping of all the characters in the Harry Potter book series. This mapping then allows to group them into, for lack of a better term, [social cliques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique). Not surprisingly, given the power and accuracy of these types of algorithms, when looking at the the characters that compose each clique, for someone familiar with the books, the mapping makes intuitive sense.
